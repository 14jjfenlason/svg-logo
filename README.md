# SVG Logo Creator

## Description

The purpose of this application is to provide the user with the ability to create a three lettered logo using node.js.

## Installation

While in the correct directory, initialize by using npm init -y. Then install inquirer and colors by typing in npm i inquirer@8.2.4 colors. Next, you can install jest using your preferred method (I used npm install --save-dev jest) From there, you are free to type in node index and complete the form as requested.
